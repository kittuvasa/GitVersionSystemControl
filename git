Right on! While diff is the command that generates the difference between two files,
patch is the command that applies those differences to the original file.

diff
diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files

diff -u
diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. 

Patch
Patch is useful for applying file differences. See the below example, which compares two files.
The comparison is saved as a .diff file, which is then patched to the original file!

Spot on! By keeping track of the changes that we make to our files, a VCS lets us know when a file changed, who changed it,
and also lets us easily roll back those changes.



 The git directory acts as a database for all the changes tracked in Git and 
 the working tree acts as a sandbox where we can edit the current versions of the files.
 
 After modifying a file, we need to stage those changes and then commit them afterwards.
